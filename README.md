## Here is the tutorial for hosting on heroku, (vercel is coming soon).
[Deploy on Heroku](https://debjit012.medium.com/how-did-i-host-my-blood-donation-diary-app-on-heroku-for-free-be03f8f4e1c9)




### What technical achievement are you most proud of?

 - This Web App will help you to manage your online Blood Donation Diary efficiently and save you time.
 - Any person with internet can request a donation.
 - All admin will get an email with requisition details.
 - You have a full list of the donor, donation, contact and patient for reference.
 - You can immediately share a donation certificate with to donor.
 - Share requisition to any social media platform, with complete control over every SEO settings.

### Tell us about you. 

I am a cancer survivor. Learning web development just to survive.

### Why made this app?

I have seen people buying blood literally next to me when I was in a hospital bed. They are so helpless. One parent needed blood for their 12yrs old son fighting with Leukemia. And they need whole blood, plasma on weekly basis. But blood Bank does not have enough stock or just refues. And they have to buy from the 3rd party blood bank / broker . It's a hart broken moment for me. I can not donate blood but can help them with creating solution for them.

### Please describe your project in detail:

With this app, my small group of friends can manage every donation we did, check everyone's blood donation, automate creating donation certificate, new email on every requisition and so on. Before using this app, we have to check a diary and contact all our friends about their availability which takes time and a lot of unnecessary effort and delay to their time-critical situation.

I have created this app to solve the problem of my own blood donation group, and found my small app can solve a big problem for every Blood Donation Group.
Every blood donation group has a ledger or diary manage by a single or two members. But the problem is it is not acceptable to everyone all the time. But this app is custom and made for specifically one purpose, to manage blood donation and donors.
I can not donate blood after surviving cancer. But I am proud that I can make their life a little easier.

This web app has 3 pages and also act as a website.

I will also add a blog and newsletter.

### What is your business model? (How are you going to make money?)

I have no idea about making any money from this app. 
But I will ask people for donation for the SASS application. But no worry I am able to run my web app for free so it can be deployed free without any issue.

## THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

I will add more feature in time.You can discuss in github section. Thank you.
